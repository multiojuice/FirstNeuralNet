# Basic Neural Network
This is my first neural network. Screen.java contains the main method which creates and runs the network. It is object oreiented where each neuron is its own class and stores its own weights.

## Instructions
Run Screen.java  
Click "Train Presets" (This will train the network on the integers 0 through 9).  
Click "Continuous Guess" (This will guess the answer after ever one button is pressed).  
Click the buttons on the screen to draw numbers.
